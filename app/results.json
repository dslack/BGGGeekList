Players will be controlling a mining company working in harsh conditions to acquire the most credits.<br/><br/>GENERAL INFO: A euro game for 2-5 players that plays in about 30-45 minutes.<br/><br/>THEME: Science Fiction. Space is a hostile environment with a known alien presence. Resources are scarce and it is commonplace for companies to mine asteroids to acquire them. It is known that aliens raid these asteroids and therefore mining companies are geared accordingly in preparation of being attacked. Lives are lost in this line of work daily, but if you run a good crew you can make it out alive and rich!<br/><br/>HOOK: Richly thematic euro incorporating dice and dice manipulation, with worker placement, resource farming and exporting.<br/><br/>WINNING CONDITION: Highest Credits when the end of the game is triggered. Credits are acquired primarily from exporting minerals mined from the asteroid.<br/><br/>MECHANICS: A round begins with rolling a set of Power Dice, these are community dice that players will use in order to successful mine the asteroid. Players then take turns placing workers throughout different space stations and on a mineral rich asteroid.<br/><br/>After all the workers have been placed a third and more volatile Power Die is rolled. A player starts his/her turn by rolling his/her Rig Dice, these represent the a power element of his/her mining equipment that is to be paired with the community Power Dice in order to successfully mine resources from the asteroid. Then he/she resolves all his/her workers. As soon as players begin exporting minerals, hostile alien ships begin patrolling and will attack every round making it more difficult to resolve all the workers successfully.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, players will be increasing their worker count, gaining and spending credits (which are the victory points), gaining additional Rig Dice and acquiring explosive Neutronium bombs to protect them from the alien attacks.<br/><br/>When 3 of the 6 resource nodes on the asteroid are void of minerals the end of the game is triggered. The round is finished and the player with the most credits wins the game.<br/><br/>","released":false},{"objectid":"149111","objectname":"Damage Report: On Fire","postdate":"2015-06-25T19:44:45.000Z","subtype":"boardgame","body":["• Available for demo games and preordering at Gen Con 2015."],"publishers":["Break From Reality Games"],"designers":["Alex Barbieri"],"description":"There&rsquo;s a strange smell in the air, smoke is drifting out of the vent down the corridor&hellip;oh no, the ship is on fire!

An army of unspeakable horrors of an ancient and forgotten race of infernal creatures awoke deep within the earth and marched across the lands. The Darkness ravished the Five Realms with death and destruction and nearly brought the continent to its knees. Faced with a desperate fight for their very survival, the great races put aside their differences and united into a warband of such magnitude and strength as had never been seen before. The world trembled.<br/><br/>Though their great loss of life on the battlefield was nearly insurmountable, the warband's sheer size overpowered the armies of Darkness and largely drove them back beneath the earth. Sorcerers and shamans and magi of the great races invoked binding blood magic to start sealing the enemy away for an eternity.

These actions can be used multiple times per round, with the first player to do so in a round receiving a bonus or more goods or reducing the number of goods paid.<br/><br/>Most buildings add extra action spaces with new actions, combined actions, and more powerful versions of basic actions.

That potential danger is why you're alone in your boat, on your own but eager to take a run on the island and try your luck.<br/><br/>For now, only the sound of the waves and the cries of the gulls disturb the peace of this seemingly idyllic island...but as soon as you set foot in the jungle bordering the beach, the drums of war start sounding and you realize that you've suddenly gained the status of prey!<br/><br/>Pingo Pingo is a hyper-frenetic action game punctuated by a soundtrack in which you have to react quickly, run, shoot a gun, in which you must be precise, brave, fast, and focused because if not, well, you might not leave the island in one piece. As soon as the soundtrack begins, the game is on!<br/><br/>On your turn, reveal the top card from your deck and place it face-up in the middle of the table. Each card requires a specific action when it is revealed. Be the first to tap on a treasure to grab it, but watch out for traps and critters, and make sure the music allows you to take this treasure. Tap on camp cards to steal cards from the other players' stashes. Adventure cards trigger actions to be completed before the &quot;Pingo Pingo&quot; cry in the soundtrack. Get up and run from one base to another to cross a suspension bridge. Grab the gun and aim well to defeat fearsome bear riders. Tap the friendly monkey sorcerer to regain life. Run to the shipwreck and back to shoot the gigantic space penguin. Grab all the previously played cards and deal them as fast as you can to escape the penguin rampage!<br/><br/>Any mistake will cost you one of your seven life points. After 15 minutes, the player with the most treasures wins the game &mdash; but don't be reckless because you can't carry more than three treasures per life point...<br/><br/>","released":false},{"objectid":"177222","objectname":"Heroes of Normandie: Sainte-Mere Eglise","postdate":"2015-06-21T17:40:23.000Z","subtype":"boardgame","body":["• Debuting at Gen Con 2015.\r\n\r\n• Price $55"],"publishers":["Devil Pig Games"],"designers":["Yann and Clem"],"description":"Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Recreate the Battle of St. Mere Eglise with the new scenario expansion Heroes of Normandie: Sainte-Mere Eglise!

Of course, if he wants to get rid of the tokens he will need a lot of cards in hand. Blue Plains is still the king of card draw. Blue Plains is also the best at moving Creatures between Landscapes. You will find that ability very useful with Frozen tokens hanging around! You will also find some very powerful Blue Plains Creatures that must move each turn, or suffer the consequences.<br/><br/>Each Card Wars starter set has a pair of different forty-card decks and is ready to play right out of the box.

In the Adventure Time episode &quot;Card Wars&quot;, Jake begs Finn to play his favorite trading card game. Finn accepts, despite warnings from Beemo on how very competitive Jake can be while playing the game. Finn and Jake battle against each other to decide who will be the Dweeb and who will be the Cool Guy.<br/><br/>Now fans can play the actual Card Wars game in Adventure Time Card Wars: Ice King vs. Marceline, with all of the action taking place in four combat lanes.<br/><br/>Each turn, a player has two Action Points to spend on Creatures, Spells, and Locations, and cards cost between 0 and 2 Action Points to play. When you summon a Creature, you choose which lane you want to place it in; some Creatures have FLOOP abilities that allow you to use their special abilities. When you attack with a Creature down a lane, you might find an opposing Creature, or you might get to deal your damage straight to your opponent's Hit Points. Reduce your opponent's Hit Points from 25 to 0 and you're the Cool Guy (and you win the game)!<br/><br/>In Adventure Time Card Wars: Ice King vs. Marceline, which contains all new cards other than a few rainbow card repeats, the Ice King and his IcyLands deck take on Marceline's dark and crafty Useless Swamps &amp; NiceLands deck. IcyLands creatures are all about attacking directly. They would prefer to avoid attacking other creatures. One way they can find some clear lanes to attack down is through frozen tokens. Through various means, these chilling tokens can be placed onto your opponent's Landscapes. Opponents will find playing creatures onto frozen landscapes rather difficult. Where the Ice King finds an opening, he will strike as hard as a blizzard!<br/><br/>Marceline's deck is a Useless Swamps &amp; NiceLands deck. This is the first time that NiceLands has been paired with another landscape type, and the chemistry is going to burn hot! The Useless Swamp side of the deck is themed around denial, discard, and dirty tricks. Some of the Useless Swamp Creatures are willing victims to your dark tidings. When they go, they leave a lot of destruction in their wake. The NiceLands side of the deck is themed around creatures with exactly five damage on them. This is a tweak to the NiceLands strategy as seen in the original NiceLands deck. There, the creatures thrived with various different amounts of damage on them. Now the trick is to get as many of your creatures as you can to have exactly five damage on them.

As the great powers of Europe stretch their colonial empires further and further, they will inevitably lay claim to a place where spirits still hold power - and when they do, the land itself will fight back alongside the islanders who live there.<br/><br/>Spirit Island is a complex and thematic cooperative game about defending your island home from colonizing Invaders. Players are different spirits of the land, each with its own unique elemental powers. Every turn, players simultaneously choose which of their power cards to play, paying energy to do so. Using combinations of power cards that match a spirit's elemental affinities can grant free bonus effects. Faster powers take effect immediately, before the Invaders spread and ravage, but other magics are slower, requiring forethought and planning to use effectively. In the Spirit phase, spirits gain energy, and choose how / whether to Grow: to reclaim used power cards, to seek for new power, or to spread presence into new areas of the island.<br/><br/>The Invaders expand across the island map in a semi-predictable fashion. Each turn they explore into some lands (portions of the island); the next turn, they build in those lands, forming settlements and cities. The turn after that, they ravage there, bringing blight to the land and attacking any native islanders present.<br/><br/>The islanders fight back against the Invaders when attacked, and lend the spirits some other aid, but may not always do so exactly as you'd hoped. Some Powers work through the islanders, helping them (eg) drive out the Invaders or clean the land of blight.<br/><br/>The game escalates as it progresses: spirits spread their presence to new parts of the island and seek out new and more potent powers, while the Invaders step up their colonization efforts. Each turn represents 1-3 years of alternate-history.<br/><br/>At game start, winning requires destroying every last settlement and city on the board - but as you frighten the Invaders more and more, victory becomes easier: they'll run away even if some number of settlements or cities remain. Defeat comes if any spirit is destroyed, if the island is overrun by blight, or if the Invader deck is depleted before achieving victory.<br/><br/>The game includes different adversaries to fight against (eg: a French Plantation Colony, or a Remote British Colony). Each changes play in different ways, and offers a different path of difficulty boosts to keep the game challenging as you gain skill.<br/><br/>","released":false},{"objectid":"175848","objectname":"Unpub: The Unpublished Card Game","postdate":"2015-06-16T01:27:40.000Z","subtype":"boardgame","body":["• Available for demo games at Gen Con 2015, and possibly available for purchase depending on when the stock arrives in the U.S.\r\n\r\n• Price $10"],"publishers":["Dice Hate Me Games","Greater Than Games, LLC"],"designers":["JR Honeycutt","Doug Levandowski"],"description":"Unpub: The Unpublished Card Game is inspired by the spirit of Unpub, an organization devoted to helping game designers craft their unpolished, unpublished stones into sparkling, publishable gems!<br/><br/>The game comes with 54 cards, each featuring a possible game theme, a core mechanism, and game components that the players will use to craft a game idea.

Hope so. Oh, it's probably not a good time to mention the shark...<br/><br/>Poseidon's Kingdom features a wave that crashes dice onto the board and the engaging game play of the highly-praised anthill system (from Antics!). On their turns, players first decide whether to improve their abilities by taking an &quot;action tile&quot; or place some of their personal dice onto the big 3D-wave, which is rolled over, when full, distributing up to 15 dice in a couple of seconds randomly all over the board.<br/><br/>Second, they move one of their two creatures on the main board, trying to land on a spot where they can pick up dice of any color they need. If they do, they can either store the dice on special spaces of their action tiles for later use OR put together a special combination of 2-4 dice to get victory point tokens, then place the dice back to the pools from where they came.<br/><br/>Third, the shark moves as many spaces as the space the creature landed on indicates. If the shark meets one or more creatures on its way, they are eaten and players get &quot;skeletons&quot; to block one of their action spaces.<br/><br/>After a special scoring round, in the end the player who collected the most victory points wins.<br/><br/>The second edition of Poseidon's Kingdom introduces the dolphin, which can make your creatures immune to the shark.<br/><br/>","released":false},{"objectid":"111097","objectname":"Villains and Vigilantes Card Game","postdate":"2015-06-15T22:42:18.000Z","subtype":"boardgame","body":["• Debuting at Gen Con 2015."],"publishers":["Game Salute","Superhuman Games"],"designers":["Ben Swainbank"],"description":"In the Villains and Vigilantes Card Game, players take on the roles of the supervillains trying to carry out a variety of sinister schemes or the heroes striving to bring them to justice.<br/><br/>This game, with characters and themes drawn from the classic superhero RPG, offers the entire comic book experience.

For such transgression, a fiery death should be the only appropriate response &mdash; but Drakon has decided to toy with you before she devours you. You and your rival heroes will each be released into the labyrinth, and the first hero to discover ten gold pieces will go free with his treasure. The rest of you will satisfy the dragon's hunger.<br/><br/>In every game of Drakon, you and your opponents must fight to stay alive in the midst of the labyrinth. On your turn, you can either move your hero to another room, or add another piece to the labyrinth, placing beneficial chambers in your own path and throwing your opponents into harm's way. But you must be cautious. The chambers of Drakon's labyrinth are filled with danger and ancient magics, not to mention the dragon herself. To navigate these deadly corridors and survive, you&rsquo;ll need to be quick and careful.<br/><br/>On every turn, you have a crucial choice to make. You can either move forward into a new chamber, or you can expand the labyrinth by playing a new chamber tile from your hand. The new chambers that you play feature unique circumstances and magical objects that you may encounter on your adventures through Drakon's lair.<br/><br/>The majority of these chambers offer powerful effects to any hero that enters the chamber. You may gain the power to destroy any chamber in the labyrinth, or call a windstorm to carry you along, increasing your movement. You may even take command of a floating chamber and fly it to the other side of the labyrinth. Other chambers force more harmful effects on those heroes unlucky enough to enter. A room may cause you to lose a coin as you avoid the dangers within, and any hero who hears the siren song of the magical harp is forced to move into its chamber. As you and your fellow heroes play these chambers from your hand, they form a cunning maze, and only the wise can find their way out.<br/><br/>Despite the power of these chambers, the central goal of your quest is to find gold: only by being the first player to claim ten gold can you escape the dungeon. Plenty of chambers allow you to find a coin or steal a coin from an opponent, but the gold value of coins can vary dramatically. Your most recently stolen coin may have a value of three gold or just one. Because coins are kept face-down, hiding their value, you'll never know exactly how close your opponents are to victory.<br/><br/>Six heroes are trapped within Drakon's sadistic labyrinth, and each hero has his own unique abilities to help him survive. Each ability can only be used once per game though, making the timing of the ability incredibly important. You may play as the sorceress and escape from a most dire situation by passing through a wall. You may play as the thief and collect the gold you need at the most opportune moment by preying on another hero. You may even play as the ranger and use a burst of speed to race across the maze when necessary. No matter which hero you play in a game of Drakon, you'll need to take full advantage of your unique ability at the opportune moment if you want to grab the gold and escape from Drakon's clutches.<br/><br/>Of course, the heroes are not alone in the labyrinth. The legendary dragon also stalks the halls and chambers of the maze, taunting any hero unlucky enough to encounter her. Certain chambers throughout the labyrinth allow you to move Drakon through the dungeon. If you can move Drakon into the same chamber as a hapless hero, that hero is immediately sent back to the entrance chamber and loses three coins, as Drakon toys with him before releasing him once more into the maze.<br/><br/>You and your rival heroes are trapped. Your greatest threat may be Drakon or the other heroes. In this dark labyrinth, only one thing can save you: your own greed. Will you ruthlessly grab gold and undermine your opponent&rsquo;s schemes before escaping to victory? Or will you fail and become just another meal for the dragon?

Each player strives to become the most powerful ruling force in the kingdom by gaining control of Fief and Bishopric territories. In turn, they acquire Royal and Ecclesiastical (church) titles which give their families influence to elect the next Pope and King. Players strengthen their positions by negotiating marriage alliances between their families, setting the stage for love, treachery and deception!<br/><br/>Fief is a classic French-language game and is being re-introduced by Academy Games in English with updated rules, new units, a new and larger consolidated map, and more. This edition also includes additional components, which enhances game play.<br/> The game board represents a portion of the Kingdom of France in the Middle Ages. Villages have square outlines that are connected by roads that allow Lord and Troop movement. The villages are grouped into eight colored background areas that represent individual Fiefs, which are domains given to Lords to preside over. Fiefs have different colored backgrounds and Bishoprics have heavy bordered outlines that include several different Fiefs. Each village also belongs to one of five church Bishoprics; each Bishopric is outlined with a heavy border line and is numbered between 1-5 along the edge of the board inside a Bishop's Mitre.<br/><br/>Each player controls up to four family members, comprised of male and female nobles. These family members will rise in power by gaining Royal and Ecclesiastic Titles.<br/><br/>In Fief: France 1429, a player may attempt to gain control of all the villages in a Fief to gain the Royal Title of Baron, Earl or Duke. For each Fief a player controls, he gains 1 VP. These Titled Lords may now take part in the election for the next King. They may even be a candidate to become King, thus bringing 1 VP and more power to the family! Other members of your family may follow the calling of the Church to gain the Ecclesiastical Titles of Bishop and then Cardinal. These titles allow you to Tithe Bishoprics, taking the Church's (i.e. &quot;your&quot;) fair share of income from other Fief Lords! The highest goal your clerical family member can attain is to be elected Pope, bringing 1 VP and special privileges to your family!<br/> You win the game as soon as you have 3 VPs. This is easier said than done and you may need to form alliances with other players through diplomacy and marriage to obtain your goal. When one of your family members marries a noble of another family, the two of you become allied. You now win the game together with 4 VPs and cannot win alone, unless your marriage is annulled by the Pope or your spouse is &quot;mysteriously&quot; murdered or dies of some other foul means!<br/><br/>In addition to being wary of your fellow players, you may draw event cards that can quickly change your destiny. Bounty Event cards are beneficial to the Player and include &quot;Good Harvest&quot;, &quot;Good Weather&quot; and &quot;Added Taxes&quot; cards. But some cards are Disaster Cards that can randomly effect all players in specific Bishoprics. These include &quot;The Plague&quot;, &quot;Heavy Rain&quot;, &quot;Famine&quot;, and &quot;Peasant Uprisings&quot;!<br/><br/>Income can be increased by players imposing church tithes on their opponent's villages or taxing their own Fiefs. Players may purchase new Fief titles, improve their village incomes with mills, and fortify their cities.<br/><br/>Players will also need to protect their land and castles. Men at Arms and Knights can be purchased, as well as Siege Engines. If you feel that other players are not running their Fiefs as well as you can, you may try to invade their territories! But you must risk one of your family members to lead the troops into possible battle, where they might be killed or taken prisoner. If two opposing armies are in the same village square, a Battle may be initiated. The players assess the size and strength of their armies, which determine the number of Battle Dice each may roll. Each &quot;f&quot; rolled is a hit. Men at Arms are defeated with one hit, while Knights require three hits to be removed from the battle.<br/><br/>The Kickstarter Edition of Fief: France 1429 included the Fief: France 1429 Expansions Pack and offered 3-D buildings and metal coins as 'add ons.'

In this game, the third standalone title in the Space Cadets franchise of cooperative/team space-themed games from Stronghold Games, players take on the roles of adventurous human spacemen who explore UFOs, acquire Alien technology and fight hostile extraterrestrials.<br/><br/>Each turn, spacemen have three action points to spend on activities such as firing their atomic rifles, analyzing exotic equipment, or subduing the malicious Brain-in-a-Jar. When the spacemen are finished, the aliens take their turns by following simple movement and combat protocols; seven types of hostile aliens threaten the players, from the repulsive mind leeches to the rampaging titanic sentinels.<br/><br/>Space Cadets: Away Missions contains twenty scenarios linked in a campaign story. Each mission features different combinations of aliens on different spaceships, with hexagonal map tiles arranged to form flying saucers, rocket ships, space stations, etc. Cooperation, tactical planning and good dice are essential if the spacemen hope to overcome the relentless horde of little green men.<br/><br/>","released":true},{"objectid":"111124","objectname":"Dark Moon","postdate":"2015-06-15T07:43:30.000Z","subtype":"boardgame","body":["• Price $60"],"publishers":["Stronghold Games","(Web published)","kártyagyár"],"designers":["Evan Derrick"],"description":"WELCOME TO DARK MOON.

Players are investors who send prospectors on a quest to find gold at various locations &mdash; in the mountains, in a forest, at a river, etc. &mdash; with each location having perils, gems, quantities of gold and bountiful supplies of silt. As players remove valuable gold cards from the location decks, silt becomes more prominent and gold harder to find.<br/><br/>Each player starts Fool's Gold with six coins and 2-4 prospectors, depending on the number of players. The game lasts five years (i.e., rounds), and at the start of each year, each player receives an additional coin and an additional prospector, giving you both more to spend and more on which to spend. Each year consists of two phases: the prospecting phase and the mining phase. During the prospecting phase, the start player rolls ten dice, then places the dice on the mines of the same number, with 6s being placed in the central camp. Each mine has a path to it starting with the numbered die, then spaces numbered 0-6. After placing dice on the mine paths, players take turns taking one of these actions:<br/><br/><br/>    Place a prospector on a mine path, paying the cost of the space you cover; whenever you pay coins, place them in front of your player screen.<br/>    Place a wild die on a mine path, paying 1 for each die already on the path.<br/>    Place a prospector in front of your screen to take back three coins.<br/>    Pass, place all of your remaining prospectors in reserve next to any mine or mines of your choice, then take back all coins and prospectors in front of your screen.<br/><br/><br/>Once everyone has passed, the mining phase begins. Starting at mine #1, shuffle the mine deck, then draw a number of cards equal to the product of the number of prospectors and the number of dice at the mine. Foul weather forces fewer cards to be drawn, while false alarms might result in treasure being snatched away from everyone. Players then choose rewards from the mine in order of priority, which is determined by the number of prospectors each player has at a mine (include those in reserve) and their location on the path; players must redetermine priority after each action at a mine. The player actions are:<br/><br/><br/>    Take a gold card from the mine.<br/>    Take a gem card from the mine, but only if you don't already have this gem.<br/>    Take two coins from the bank, which gives you additional funds for the rest of the game.<br/>    Lay down your prospector (removing it from priority) and wait for winter.<br/><br/><br/>Once all standing miners have been removed, roll the winter die and draw that many cards for winter. If any goods come up, those layabout prospectors finally get to profit; if not, tough cookies, sourdough! After five rounds, players compare their findings, losing points if they've failed to collect gold from each mine. In addition, each player must throw out all the gold from the mine where he found the most. Turns out it was so easy to find because it was fool's gold!

The Ravens are gathering, many of whom used to be rivals. Will you rise to power or simply be...nevermore.<br/><br/>Nevermore is a casual-style, card-drafting game in which you quickly build your hand each round, collecting cards you want and poisoning your opponent's hand by passing along cards you think they can't use. Whoever holds the most of a given suit, gains the power of that suit to attack, heal, acquire Light or Shadow magicks and score victory points.<br/><br/>Will you transform all your rivals into ravens &mdash; or can they regain their human form in time to score enough victory to win?<br/><br/><br/>Nevermore can be taught in less than five minutes, yet hides a surprising amount of depth in strategy, as players try to outwit and outmaneuver their opponents. Player &lsquo;transformation&rsquo; replaces player elimination, keeping everyone in the game until the last moment, yet still rewards players who have performed better during the game. That's because a player who has become a Raven cannot win until they can find a way to transform back, but they still play, helping to doom other players and trying to collect one of two specific hands (all of one suit - or - one of every suit) to become human again.<br/><br/>Short game length encourages multiple plays per session and appeals to players of all skill levels &ndash; with plenty of underhanded plotting and backstabby goodness.<br/><br/><br/>Play Overview:<br/><br/>Players are dealt a hand of 5 cards - but they will not keep them all.<br/>During the drafting phase, players must pass three of those cards to the player on their left. From their new set of five, they must then pass two to the left. Lastly, they will pass one card left - ending the drafting phase with a final drafted hand of five cards. They will have attempted to collect cards from a certain suit (or two) trying to be the player who has the most of that suit this hand - and also carefully managing what they are passing to their opponent, to make sure they don't end up with too powerful a hand.<br/><br/>During the resolution phase, each suit is called for, one at a time. All players show cards from that suit simultaneously. The player with the most gains the power of the suit - and the strength of the ability is determined by subtracting the second highest total of that suit. Example: I hold three Attack cards. Two other players each hold one Attack card. (3-1=2) I do a 2 point attack on a player I choose. Healing, Victory points and Radiance (which draws a Light Magick card for each you have minus the second highest amount) all work the same way. All but Ravens, who kill cards of other suits in your hand. Example: I have 3 Victory, 1 Attack and 1 Raven. I must choose to sacrifice either 1 Attack or 1 Victory card from my hand as they are Resolved. Certain special hands give additional benefits and/or Victory points.<br/><br/>If your 5 Health points drop to 0, you become a Raven, still in the game, but unable to win until you can transform back.<br/><br/>The winner is either the last human player standing - or the first to score 6 Victory points.<br/><br/>","released":false},{"objectid":"172818","objectname":"Above and Below","postdate":"2015-06-15T05:05:41.000Z","subtype":"boardgame","body":["• Available for previewing at Gen Con 2015 ahead of its retail release in November 2015."],"publishers":["Red Raven Games"],"designers":["Ryan Laukat"],"description":"Your last village was ransacked by barbarians.

Stockpile centers around the idea that nobody knows everything about the stock market, but everyone does know something. In the game, this philosophy manifests in two ways: insider information and the stockpile.<br/><br/>First, players are given insider information each round. This information dictates how a stock&rsquo;s value will change at the end of the round. By privately learning if a stock is going to move up or down, each player has a chance to act ahead of the market by buying or selling at the right time.<br/><br/>Second, players purchase their stocks by bidding on piles of cards called stockpiles. These stockpiles will contain a mixture of face-up and face-down cards placed by other players in the game. In this way, nobody will know all of the cards in the stockpiles. Not all cards are good either. Trading fees can poison the piles by making players pay more than they bid. By putting stocks and other cards up for auction, Stockpile catalyzes player interaction, especially when potential profits from insider information are on the line.<br/><br/>Both of these mechanisms are combined with some stock market elements to make players consider multiple factors when selling a stock. Do you hold onto a stock in hopes of catching a lucrative stock split or do sell now to avoid the potential company bankruptcy? Can you hold onto your stock until the end of the game to become the majority shareholder, or do you need the liquidity of cash now for future bidding? Do you risk it all by investing heavily into one company, or do you mitigate your risk by diversifying your portfolio?<br/><br/>In the end, everyone knows something about the stock market, so it all comes down to strategy execution.

While the winner of an auction can claim buildings on certain peninsulas, the players who have passed are also rewarded: Not only do they receive goods like grog bottles or treasure maps but they also visit merchant ships where they can trade these goods for money, parrots or treasure chests. The auction mechanism of Grog Island makes for tactical and interesting gameplay as in certain moments, passing can be almost as rewarding as winning an auction. Finding the right balance between bidding and backing out is the key to winning.<br/><br/>The game ends as soon as one player has claimed a certain number of buildings, then all players score the secret goal cards they received both at the start of and during the game.

El Presidente draws cards face down from the money deck (which varies in denomination from $1 to $3) and must propose a budget for the year, distributing the money as he sees fit amongst the various offices. Of course, loyalty to him is usually rewarded, while those pesky &quot;thorns in his side&quot; are usually cut off completely. The beauty of all this, though, is that El Presidente can &mdash; and most always does &mdash; keep some of the loot for himself. And since no one but he knows the value of what he drew, no one knows how much he's keeping. Suspicion is always keen.<br/><br/>Players may attempt to assassinate the other players by guessing where they will be from among five locations. Players who successfully assassinate another player take that player's money, as the only safe money is the money that has been deposited in a Swiss bank account, and the only way to get to the bank is to survive the assassination round.<br/><br/>If the players are unhappy, and there is an excuse, they can call for a coup, where the opposition players seek to take control of a majority of the power centers. Rebel players control the forces of the role which they were assigned (e.g. army, navy, air force), and players loyal to El Presidente do the same, seeking to control the strongholds until the rebellion is quelled.<br/><br/>The goal is to amass the greatest wealth secreted away in your Swiss bank account.<br/><br/>","released":false},{"objectid":"174570","objectname":"Legendary Encounters: A Predator Deck Building Game","postdate":"2015-04-20T20:43:55.000Z","subtype":"boardgame","body":[""],"publishers":["Upper Deck Entertainment"],"designers":["Ben Cichoski","Danny Mandel"],"description":"Legendary Encounters: A Predator Deck Building Game, based on the first two movies of the &quot;Predator&quot; series, is a cooperative game with original art.
